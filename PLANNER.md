1. Keeping annonymous user not alloting a random one, prolly bad ux?
2. This site is without auth so why not keep everything on server this isn't personal data
3. Add a logger for developer and do logging

## TODO

1. Add titles on the buttons
2. Maybe a devmode button? Which shows advanced messages
3. Goto Top
4. If I have opened a user means I have his data like images, so next time if in feed I get that user again, I can show his image from cache in Slider
5. Use color as post gradient like Hulu?
6. Skeleton loading?
